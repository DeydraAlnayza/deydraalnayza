        <h1>DEYDRA ALNAYZA</h1> 
        <p>I was born on August 17th, 2006, the same day as Indonesia's Independence Day. I used to read a lot when I was a child and I had stopped reading until recently. Now I find happiness again while reading a book. I watch anime and movies a lot, and I love swimming and playing badminton. I also love physics, especially Newton's work, though I'm not good at it. In my 18 years of living, I have never achieved anything. I'm the most ordinary person who wasn't born with an amazing heart, brain, muscle, or beauty. When I'm in college, everyone is so interesting and talented. I always have the thought of "I want to be part of it and not just admiring from afar." But how much can words change? Until one day, I stepped into the 'bengkel' and said I want to be a part of it, and I'll do it.</p>
